Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
Now is the time that face should form another,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
